Uno-Reverse: Hackathon Winning Prediction üèÜ

Project Overview
Uno-Reverse: Hackathon Winning Prediction is a machine learning project designed to forecast the success potential of hackathon ideas. It uses historical data and predictive modeling to provide data-driven insights, helping teams select high-potential concepts and make strategic decisions.

Key Features & Methodology
The core of the project involves building and deploying a machine learning model for prediction:


Predictive Model: Built a machine learning model using linear regression to predict high-potential hackathon ideas.


High Accuracy: The model achieved an accuracy of 87% on validation data.


Data Analysis: Analyzed over 5,000+ past hackathon entries to identify key success factors using data-driven insights.


Scoring Algorithm: Engineered predictive scoring algorithms (on a 0-100 scale) to enhance decision-making and strategic idea selection.


üõ†Ô∏è Installation and Setup
To run this project locally, you will primarily need Python for the ML model and JavaScript/Node.js for the server and frontend.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x

Node.js

1. Clone the Repository

Bash

git clone https://github.com/Agamdeep555/Uno-reverse

2. Backend (ML and Logic)
Navigate to the directory containing your Python files and set up the necessary environment:

Install Dependencies: Install Python libraries required for the linear regression model and data analysis.

Bash

# Assuming your ML dependencies (like pandas, scikit-learn) are listed here.
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run Python Scripts: Execute any necessary setup or data processing scripts.

Bash

python industrylabel.py
# ... other initial scripts


Thank you for the clarification. It seems the project named "Uno-Reverse" is actually focused on Hackathon Winning Prediction using Machine Learning, not the "MatchMyResume" application. The previous PDF, which was also named "Introduction-to-Uno-Reverse.pptx-2.pdf," was misleading as its content described "MatchMyResume."

Based on the correct project details you've provided, which focus on ML development, and the files in the GitHub repository image, here is the new, accurate README file.

üíª Repository Structure
The files in the repository suggest a typical structure for a web-based ML project:

Directory/File	Type	Purpose
py files/	Folder	Contains core Python scripts for ML model training, data analysis, and utility functions (e.g., script2.py, script3.py, industrylabel.py).
js/	Folder	Contains core JavaScript files (e.g., fetch.js).
server.js	File	The server-side component, likely handling API requests and serving predictions.
index2.html, demo-seo-agency-*.html	Files	Front-end files for the web interface where users can input data and view predictions.
tempCodeRunnerFile.python	File	A temporary Python file, likely for testing.
frequent.json, googlesearch.json, test2.json	Files	JSON files used for configuration, data storage, or model input/output.
LICENSE, README.md	Files	Standard project documentation.
üõ†Ô∏è Installation and Setup

3. Server (API)
The project uses a Node.js server.

Install Node Dependencies:

Bash
npm install
Start the Server:

Bash
node server.js

4. Frontend (Web Interface)
The web interface allows interaction with the prediction model.

Open index2.html (or a similar entry point like demo-seo-agency-contact.html) in your web browser, assuming the server (server.js) is running and serving the necessary data.
